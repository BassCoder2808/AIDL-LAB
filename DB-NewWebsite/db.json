It is also considered one of the simplest and most general methods used for supervised training of multilayered neural networks. Backpropagation works by approximating the non-linear relationship between the input and the output by adjusting the weight values internally. It can further be generalized for the input that is not included in the training patterns (predictive abilities).</p><p>Generally, the Backpropagation network has two stages, training and testing. During the training phase, the network is \"shown\" sample inputs and the correct classifications. For example, the input might be an encoded picture of a face, and the output could be represented by a code that corresponds to the name of the person.</p><p>A further note on encoding information - a neural network, as most learning algorithms, needs to have the inputs and outputs encoded according to an arbitrary user defined scheme. The scheme will define the network architecture so that once a network is trained, the scheme cannot be changed without creating a totally new net. Similarly there are many forms of encoding the network response.</p><p>The following figure shows the topology of the Backpropagation neural network that includes and input layer, one hidden layer and an output layer. It should be noted that Backpropagation neural networks can have more than one hidden layer.</p><center><img style=\"width: 1879px;\" src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/e2b.png\"></center><br><br><br><h2>Procedure</h2><center><div><strong>Step 0.</strong>&nbsp;Set w and alpha (learning to random rate) values.<br><strong>Step 1.</strong>&nbsp;Perform steps 2 to 9 when stopping condition is false.<br><strong>Step 2.</strong>&nbsp;Perform steps 3 to 8 for each training pair.<br><strong>Step 3.</strong>&nbsp;Receive ip signal from xi and transfer to zj<br><strong>Step 4.</strong>&nbsp;In Hidden Unit calculate the net ip and op:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/eqn_netip.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\"><br><img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/eqn_netop.png\" width=\"125\" height=\"40\"><br>The function used above is the bipolar sigmoid ie:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/eqn_bipolar_sigmoid.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"40\"><br>Its binary counterpart is:<img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/eqn_binary_sigmoid.png\" width=\"75\" height=\"40\"><br><strong>Step 5.</strong>&nbsp;Similarly, calculate the net ip and op for each op unit.<br><strong>Step 6.</strong>&nbsp;Calculate error correction factor for o/p unit.<br><img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/eqn_err.png\" width=\"175\" height=\"40\"><br><img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/eqn_total_err.png\" width=\"175\" height=\"40\"><br>and send this to hidden layer<br><strong>Step 7.</strong>&nbsp;Each hidden unit \"j\", sums its delta inputs from op units.<br><img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/eqn_offset.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"><br><strong>Step 8.</strong>&nbsp;Update the weight by weight(new) = weight(old) + offset<br><strong>Step 9.</strong>&nbsp;Check for stopping condition<br>*train certain no. of epochs<br>*where actual op equals to target op</div></center><br><br><br><h2>Illustration</h2><center><img style=\"width: 1879px;\" src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/e2c.png\"><img style=\"width: 1879px;\" src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/Backpropagation/e2d.png\"></center><br><br><br><h2>References</h2><center><a href=\"https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/\">a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/</a></center></div>",

The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable\"s value is called the independent variable. This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable. Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values. There are simple linear regression calculators that use a &ldquo;least squares&rdquo; method to discover the best-fit line for a set of paired data. You then estimate the value of X (dependent variable) from Y (independent variable).<br><br></h2><h1>Cost Function</h1><p>The cost function of the linear regression is</p><h2><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/518/1*Ufonqa20VceIYU0i2UfMnQ.png\"></h2><p>To make it simpler for our understanding, let\"s rewrite it as</p><h2><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*mDEzcRicu3Oc2rrvB7A-uw.png\"></h2><p>Here m means the total number of examples in your dataset.

It is also known as a generalized linear model that uses a logit-link. Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for a given set of features(or inputs), X.<br>Logistic regression becomes a classification technique only when a decision threshold is brought into the picture. The setting of the threshold value is a very important aspect of Logistic regression and is dependent on the classification problem itself. The decision for the value of the threshold value is majorly affected by the values of precision and recall. Ideally, we want both precision and recall to be 1, but this seldom is the case.<strong>Assumptions for Logistic Regression:</strong><br>1. The dependent variable must be categorical in nature.<br>2. The independent variable should not have multi-collinearity.<br><br><strong>Logistic Regression Equation:</strong><br>The Logistic regression equation can be obtained from the Linear Regression equation. The mathematical steps to get Logistic Regression equations are given below<br>We know the equation of the straight line can be written as:<br>y = bo + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + ... +bnxn<br>In Logistic Regression y can be between 0 and 1 only, so for this let's divide the above equation by (1-y):<br>y / (1-y); 0 for y=0 and infinity for y=1;<br>The above equation is the final equation for Logistic Regression.<br><br>Steps in Logistic Regression: To implement the Logistic Regression using Python, we will use the same steps as we have done in previous topics of Regression. Below are the steps:<br>1. Data Pre-processing step 2. Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set 3. Predicting the test result 4. Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix) 5.

They are crucial in the creation of images. In the area of unsupervised machine learning, autoencoders are highly helpful. They can be used to lower the dimensions of the data and compress it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Autoencoders and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) vary primarily from each other in regards that while PCA identifies the directions along which data can be projected with the least amount of variation, Autoencoders rebuild our original input from a compressed version of it. This can be understood from the diagram below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://github.com/BassCoder2808/AIDL-Images/raw/main/AutoEncoder/aboutAutoEncoder.f4eb8e9e.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An autoencoder can be used to recreate the original data from the compressed data if someone requires it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Types of Autoencoders:</p><ol><li><p>Under complete Autoencoders&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Sparse Autoencoders</p></li><li><p>Contractive Autoencoders</p></li><li><p>Denoising Autoencoders</p></li><li><p>Variational Autoencoders&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Autoencoders are generally used for:</p><ol><li style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\"><p>Anomaly detection</p></li><li style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\"><p>Data denoising image and audio</p></li><li style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\"><p>Image inpainting</p></li><li style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\"><p>Information retrieval</p></li></ol></div></div>",
